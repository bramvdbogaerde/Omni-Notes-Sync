Omni-Notes Sync
===============

This is a test application currently in development to test my own fork of Omni-Notes that enables other apps to access the notes stored by Omni-Notes. The goal of this app is to provide simple sync of your Omni-Notes to services like Dropbox, Google Drive, etc... This app would only be for demonstration purposes and is meant to act like a reference application for future sync clients.
